# Games Tracker

A project to track your games collection and categorise by completion status.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Testing

To run the tests for active development:

```bash
yarn test:watch
```

The tests will run in the terminal and re-run upon saving changes.
